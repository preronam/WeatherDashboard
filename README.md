# WeatherDashboard
Weather Dashboard displays the weather for a given city and provides a 5 day forecast

This project is a Weather Dashboard which has the following features:

1. The application allows the user to search for any city and provides the current weather conditions for the user's search input
2. The weather information provided to the user includes the temperature, the humidity, the windspeed, and the UV index for a given date
3. The user is also given a 5-day forecast for the city that they searched
4. The application also stores the user's most recent search item after they close their browser
5. Once the user reopens the application, they are able to view their last searched city and the corresponding weather conditions 

To develop this project, the following processes were implemented:
1) Javascript was used to dynamically generate elements on the page and retrieve weather data from the Openweather API
2) Bootstrap was used for styling along with an external style sheet
3) Moment.js was used to format the date
